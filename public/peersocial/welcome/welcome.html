  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>Welcome to PeerSocial, a P2P driven social network. The Goal is to have a friendly network with tools to create interactions.</p>
  
  <h1>Intended Use</h1>
  <p>We intend this app to be decentralized. Allowing You and your Peers to control what you see and do without restrictions.</p>
  
  <h1>Goal Example use</h1>
  <h3>Alice and Bob</h3>
  <p>Bob is a Developer and Alice is a peer. Bob has this idea to build a game, so he builds it in PeerSocial. Bob then publishes the code to his profile. Alice then can now run the published code on PeerSocial, alowing both Bob and Alice to interact within the game together. </p>
  <p>This above example has a lot of holes to be filled. For example <b>TRUST</b> , a lot of people blindly trust a developer to be perfect and honest. And a Bad Peer may try to attack a Good Peer using the Example use.</p>
  
  <h1>What Comes with PeerSocial</h1>
  <p>PeerSocial comes with the basic stuff, Peer Management, Profile Management, and PeerApp Management Framework</p>
  <p>With These 3 Things, A Peer who can write code can create a "PeerApp" to called PeerFeed. and PeerFeed can be a feed of posts that a peer followes.</p>
  
  
  <h1>How Does PeerSocial Work</h1>
  <p>First Lets Talk about where the peer data is stored, GUN is an ecosystem of tools that let you build community run and encrypted applications. Storing the data in a p2p network allows you interact with the cloud in a different way of thinking.
