        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Welcome to PeerSocial.io, a P2P driven social network. The Goal is to have a friendly network of apps to share and create interactions. Think of this like Every Social Media Network there is rolled into one. But there is a catch! We have to build it.</p>
    
        <h1>Decentralized Use</h1>
        <p>We intend this app to be decentralized. Allowing You and your Peers to control what you see and do with your own code. </p>
    
        <h1>Example use</h1>
        <h5>Alice and Bob</h5>
        <p>Bob is a Developer and Alice is a peer. Bob has this idea to build a game, so he builds it in PeerSocial.io. Bob then publishes the code to his profile. Alice then can now run the published code on PeerSocial.io, allowing both Bob and Alice to interact
            within the game together with GUN and PeerSocial.io. </p>
        <p>This above example has a lot of holes to be filled. For example <b>TRUST</b> , as we work on that dont forget a lot of people blindly trust a developer to be perfect and honest. And a Bad Peer may try to attack a Good Peer using the Example use.</p>
    
        <h1>What Comes with PeerSocial.io</h1>
        <p>PeerSocial.io comes with the basic stuff, Peer and Profile Management, and Most importantly "PeerApp" Management Framework</p>
        <p>With These 3 Things, A Peer who can code in PeerSocial.io can create a "PeerApp" called PeerFeed. and PeerFeed can be a feed of posts that a peer follows that uses that app.</p>
    
    
        <h1>How Does PeerSocial.io Work</h1>
        <p>First Lets Talk about where the peer data is stored, GUN is an ecosystem of tools that let you build community run and encrypted applications. Storing the data in a p2p network with GUN allows you to interact with the cloud in a different way of communication using the tools we have today.
            <a href="https://gun.eco">Take a look Here </a></p>
    
        <p>So anybody can take the source and modify it for their community needs.. or they can build within PeerSocial.io and expand within it.</p>
    
        <h1>Privacy</h1>
        <p>Privacy is always a concern and you should take that into account when building and using apps in the community. PeerSocial.io.io has no liability to your data. You are the person responable for your own actions.</p>
    
        <h1>How new is this?</h1>
        <p>SocialPeer.io was conceived on 12/15/2019, so its just a baby. Expect things to break or just not work! we know this. So I invite you to contribute to help grow and fix these issues with us.</p>
        
        <h1>Not Production Ready!</h1>
        <p>As we cometogher and focus on the API for PeerApps, there is a lot of changes to be made. Your Data may get Removed.</p>
        
        <h1>The Source?</h1>
        <p>It Lives @ <a href="https://github.com/PeerSocial-io/PeerSocial.io">https://github.com/PeerSocial-io/PeerSocial.io</a></p>
