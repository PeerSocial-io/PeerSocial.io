  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>Welcome to PeerSocial, a P2P driven social network. The Goal is to have a friendly network with tools to create interactions. Think of me like im Every Social Media Network there is rolled into one. But there is a catch! You have to build it.</p>

  <h1>Intended Use</h1>
  <p>We intend this app to be decentralized. Allowing You and your Peers to control what you see and do without restrictions. </p>

  <h1>Goal Example use</h1>
  <h3>Alice and Bob</h3>
  <p>Bob is a Developer and Alice is a peer. Bob has this idea to build a game, so he builds it in PeerSocial. Bob then publishes the code to his profile. Alice then can now run the published code on PeerSocial, allowing both Bob and Alice to interact within
    the game together. </p>
  <p>This above example has a lot of holes to be filled. For example <b>TRUST</b> , a lot of people blindly trust a developer to be perfect and honest. And a Bad Peer may try to attack a Good Peer using the Example use.</p>

  <h1>What Comes with PeerSocial</h1>
  <p>PeerSocial comes with the basic stuff, Peer Management, Profile Management, and PeerApp Management Framework</p>
  <p>With These 3 Things, A Peer who can write code can create a "PeerApp" to called PeerFeed. and PeerFeed can be a feed of posts that a peer follows.</p>


  <h1>How Does PeerSocial Work</h1>
  <p>First Lets Talk about where the peer data is stored, GUN is an ecosystem of tools that let you build community run and encrypted applications. Storing the data in a p2p network with GUN allows you to interact with the cloud in a different way of thinking.

  <p>So anybody can take the source and modify it for there community needs.. or they can build within PeerSocial and expand within it.</p>

  <h1>Privacy</h1>
  <p>Privacy is always a concern and you should take that into account when building apps for the community.</p>

  <h1>How new is this?</h1>
  <p>SocialPeer.io was conceived on 12/15/2019, so its just a baby. Expect things to break or just not work! we know this. So I invite you to contribute to help grow and fix these issues with us.</p>
