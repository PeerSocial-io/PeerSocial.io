## *The* Secure Render

This is a fork of Secure Render that includes an app/game engine.

 > The last security audit was end of 2021, for any code since then, please help audit.

Check [@SecureRender](https://twitter.com/SecureRender) for some cool demos.

### Install

Secure Render is a proposed browser standard, this code works as both a polyfill that can be loaded as a library but also as a browser extension.

 > Secure Render has not published the security origin polyfill yet, so to alpha test developing an app or game you will need to use the extension.

1. Clone or download this repo, unzip if needed.

2. Go to "chrome://extensions/" in your URL bar, or similar in Firefox/others.

3. Toggle developer mode on.

4. Click `load unpacked`, select this unzipped folder.

5. Copy `examples/1-hello-world.html` to start building your own app/game.

### Documentation

We hold pair programming hacking hours about weekly, for now while in alpha you will need to join these calls or tweet at us to get help. Please add to the examples folder to help documentation improve with tutorials.
