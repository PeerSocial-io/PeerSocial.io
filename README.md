This source if ugly, im sorry about that.. but im fine tuneing it RIGHT NOW! as this is ALPHA so please check back next week for more cleaner and tasteful reading. OR  you can submit an issue here in github.

Keep in mind the next few weeks are going to be focused on cleanup and typos.. I may have a few thing that are not any longer used or just not nessary at all.
