this source if ugly, im sorry about that.. but im fine tuneing it RIGHT NOW! so please check back next week for more cleaner and tasteful reading. OR  you can fork it can create a PR :) 

keep in mine the next few weeks are going to be focused on cleanup.. i created this in a day so. i may have a few thing that are not any longer used or just not nessary at all.
