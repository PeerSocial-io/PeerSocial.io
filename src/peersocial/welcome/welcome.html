        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Welcome to PeerSocial.io, a P2P Social Network. The goal is to have a friendly network of apps to share and create interactions. Think of this like Every Social Media Network there is rolled into one. But there is a catch! We have to build it.</p>

        <h1>Decentralized!</h1>
        <p>This is decentralized with central services. You are in control of your data. Private Data is Encrypted. Stored in the public. Protected with encryption.</p>

        <h1>OpenSource!</h1>
        <p>This is OpenSource, So anybody can take the source and modify it for their community needs, or they can build within PeerSocial.io and expand within it. Now let's talk about where the peer data is stored, GUN is an ecosystem of tools that let you build community-run and encrypted applications. Storing the data within a p2p network with GUN allows you to interact with others in a different way of communication.
            <a href="https://gun.eco">Take a look at GUN</a></p>

        <h1>Privacy!</h1>
        <p>Privacy is always a concern and PeerSocial.io has no liability or rights to your data. You are the person responsible for your data and actions.</p>

        <h1>How new is this?</h1>
        <p>SocialPeer.io was conceived on 12/15/2019 and is currently in beta. So I invite you to contribute to help grow and fix these issues with us.</p>
